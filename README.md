# Data-Analysis-for-education-non-profit

Given access to a database containing the records of 2,000 individuals who are
either donors to our non-profit or are affiliated in some way:

1. Look at the different attributes in the database and build a Tableau dashboard to track at
least 4 KPIâ€™s. 
2. Publish the dashboard to the Tableau server.
3. Build a dataset from the database of derived attributes that we use to build a
statistical model.
4. Using derived attributes, we built a logistical regression model in R to predict the
likelihood of an individual becoming a donor.
